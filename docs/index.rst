BOSCH BMP180
************

The BMP180 is a digital fully calibrated barometric pressure sensor of Bosch Sensortec, with a very high performance. This sensor enables applications in advanced mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet PCs and sports devices. The ultra-low power consumption down to 3 μA makes the BMP180 one of the best sensor in terms of power saving for your mobile devices.

For optimum system integration the BMP180 is equipped with digital bidirectional I2C interface; Typical applications can regard indoor navigation, GPS-enhancement (for dead-reckoning, slope detection, etc.), weather forecast, vertical velocity indication (rise/sink speed), and many more.
